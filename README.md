# Conan Model Painting Planner
Greedy algorithm to maximize scenarios opened per model group painted in Conan

This is code in R. See [the-overlord.net](https://the-overlord.net/index.php?/topic/314-a-scenario-per-group-painted/) for an example application.

Theoretically, it could be used for any game by creating a similar spreadsheet for import.
